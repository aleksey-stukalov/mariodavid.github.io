Basically developing an application in [CUBA](https://www.cuba-platform.com/) is mostly about productivity. It has other advantages, but productivity is probably one of the most important reasons. To ramp up productivity on all stages of CUBA app development, we can invite Groovy to the party.


<!-- more -->

In this blog post i will give you a little guideline how to change the language of a CUBA App from Java to Groovy.
Why? Because in my opinion this productivity advantage of CUBA falls apart when going away from generating the UI or creating the domain model to the part of programming where you actually want to implement business logic. In this scenario you are back at a good old POJO model either in your Controller logic or in the services that are just Spring beans. This is because after striping everything down to efficiency except the raw business logic and probably some database access or ui related logic is the last part that remains.

Coming from a Groovy background and haven't developed in Java for quite some time, it feels a little bit clumsy to go back. This is why i think it's probably worth thinking about raising the productivity grain just a little bit by getting the different benefits of the Groovy language onto our CUBA application.

### The elevator pitch for Groovy

Ok, for an elevator pitch, the easiest thing is to come up with is syntax. We as programmers all love to care about syntax, so here we are. A basic customer POJO class in Java:

{% highlight java %}
import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.Date;

public class Customer {

    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private Date birthday;
    private Collection<Order> orders;

    public Customer() {}

    public Customer(String firstName, String lastName, Date birthday, Collection<Order> orders) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.birthday = birthday;
        this.orders = orders;
    }

    public String getFirstName() {
        return firstName;
    }

    public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
    }

    public String getLastName() {
        return lastName;
    }

    public void setLastName(String lastName) {
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    public Date getBirthday() {
        return birthday;
    }

    public void setBirthday(Date birthday) {
        this.birthday = birthday;
    }

    public Collection<Order> getOrders() {
        return orders;
    }

    public void setOrders(Collection<Order> orders) {
        this.orders = orders;
    }
    
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Customer{" +
                "firstName='" + firstName + '\'' +
                ", lastName='" + lastName + '\'' +
                ", birthday=" + birthday +
                ", orders=" + orders +
                '}';
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;

        Customer customer = (Customer) o;

        if (firstName != null ? !firstName.equals(customer.firstName) : customer.firstName != null) return false;
        if (lastName != null ? !lastName.equals(customer.lastName) : customer.lastName != null) return false;
        if (birthday != null ? !birthday.equals(customer.birthday) : customer.birthday != null) return false;
        return orders != null ? orders.equals(customer.orders) : customer.orders == null;

    }


    public int calculateTurnover() {
        int totalTurnover = 0;
        
        for(Order order: orders) {
            totalTurnover += order.getAmount();
        }
        
        return totalTurnover;
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        int result = firstName != null ? firstName.hashCode() : 0;
        result = 31 * result + (lastName != null ? lastName.hashCode() : 0);
        result = 31 * result + (birthday != null ? birthday.hashCode() : 0);
        result = 31 * result + (orders != null ? orders.hashCode() : 0);
        return result;
    }
}


{% endhighlight %}

The equivalent in Groovy:

{% highlight groovy %}
import groovy.transform.EqualsAndHashCode
import groovy.transform.ToString

@ToString
@EqualsAndHashCode
class Customer {
    String firstName
    String lastName
    Date birthday
    Collection<Order> orders = []

    int calculateTurnover() {
        orders*.amount.sum() ?: 0
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

**That's it**. It has the same functionality. 

Just in case you think i'm kidding: The Unit test in this in this [article](https://www.accelebrate.com/blog/call-pogo-name/) proves that both variants are semantically equivalent.

Groovy basically has a significant better *signal to noice ratio*. I'm not sure, if you noticed it, but there is a little bit of signal in this class. It's the method <code>calculateTurnover</code>, which is basically the "business logic" if you will. In the Java class this *signal* is very hard to find, since it's just not very visible. 

### The differences of Groovy

When going through the different stuff that is different, we will see the following:

* added default imports
* removed <code>;</code>
* changed default visibility scope: <code>private</code> for fields and <code>public</code> for methods, because that's the defacto default in Java
* removed *Getters* and *Setters*, will be generated by the compiler in the default case
* removed *constructors* and added a map based constructor as well as a default one
* removed <code>toString</code>, <code>equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code> because of the AST-Transformation Annotation

We could even reduce it further with <code>@Canonical</code> instead of <code>@ToString</code> and <code>@EqualsAndHashCode</code>.
A running example of this you'll find [here](http://goo.gl/UmkYw2) (which is a very good playground to start with btw.)


### Groovy shines with Maps and Lists

Since bashing about Java Getters and Setters is not my main purpose here, let's have a look at some more interessting stuff like the implementation of <code>calculateTurnover</code>.

{% highlight groovy %}
int calculateTurnover() {
    orders*.amount.sum() ?: 0
}
{% endhighlight %}

Groovy has some very interessting features regarding the Collections API. [In the official docs](http://www.groovy-lang.org/groovy-dev-kit.html) you'll find a good overview of the features (2. Working with collections). I'll guide you through a few of them.

Starting with the <code>*</code> Operator. The attribute orders is a collection. When doing a *. on a collection, it will execute the thing after the <code>.</code> for each items in the collection. The result of this is a List with the results of each entry. If you are familiar with functional programming, the [Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(higher-order_function)) operation would be something similar.

Then, since <code>orders*.amount</code> returns a list, we can call the operation <code>sum</code> on it, which will act according to it's name. The elvis operator <code>?:</code> will either return the expression on the left if it's not <code>null</code>, otherwise it will return the right side.

if this is to scary to you, another alternative implementation would be something like:
{% highlight groovy %}
int calculateTurnover() {
    def sum = 0
    orders.each {
        sum += it.amount
    }
    sum
}
{% endhighlight %}

This example is a little closer to what we saw in the Java class. <code>each</code> is a method on a List, that takes a [closure](http://www.groovy-lang.org/closures.html) (a function) as a parameter. On each element in the list the function will be executed and <code>it</code> will be the corresponding list item. Same story as Java 8 Lambdas.

There are two additional things that are worth mentioning. First, as i said, the each method has one argument: a closure. In groovy, often times it is not required to use parentheses at all. In this case, it is equivalent to <code>orders.each({ sum += it.amount })</code> (see the [docs](http://www.groovy-lang.org/style-guide.html) - "5. Omitting parentheses" for more details). Second, <code>return</code> is an optional keyword. If it's not in place, groovy will use the last expression of the method as the return value.

Since the sub header talks about List and *Maps*, let's have a short look at this first class language construct of groovy.

Here we have a few examples on how groovy handles Maps:

{% highlight groovy %}
def map = ["hello" : "world", "lorem" : "ipsum"]

assert map["hello"] == "world"
assert map.lorem == "ipsum"

// create a customer with a map constructor
def customer = new Customer([
	firstName: "Mario", 
	lastName: "David", 
	orders: [
		new Order(amount: 150)
	]
])

{% endhighlight %}

The map constructor gives you a cartesian product on the possible constructors. Using a map as the parameter list in general (not just in the constructor) can be a very good idea, because it drastically increases the readability of the code compared to parameter lists where the third and the firth parameter is a boolean, and nobody is able to know what that actually indicates. 

More differences that differtiates Groovy from Java can be found in the [Groovy style guide](http://www.groovy-lang.org/style-guide.html).

By the way, <code>==</code> is not a reference comparison like in Java. Instead the <code>equals</code> method of the objects are called, because like before:

<div class="well">Groovy changes the default behavior to something that makes sence in most cases</div>
