A few years ago i stumbled upon the term "undifferentiated heavy lifting". As it turns out it was most prominently used by Jeff Bezos and Werner Vogels, C level executives at Amazon. When you look at the origins of the Amazon Web Services offerings, this is basically the core of why they exists.

Undifferentiated heavy lifting in the context of IT operations describes the situation that there has to be done a lot of stuff in the IT departments, while only a very small part of this is directly related to the business outcome.

* installing anti virus updates on windows client fleet
* manage cisco switch firmware upgrades
